## 🚀 Overview

The **Bash Scripting Suite** is designed to help system administrators and Linux enthusiasts quickly gather system information, monitor CPU & disk usage, and check running processes — all through automated scripts.  
This project is part of my *System Automation* assignment and demonstrates core Bash scripting principles like file handling, process management, and system resource monitoring.
